this is a project to implement several different encryption / ciphering algorithms into a tkinter gui application

## planned features
- 3 or more custom encryption algorithms
	- my aim is to not use any code / algorithms that i found online
	- this means that i just have to rely on my own logical thinking skills to make the most secure encryption algorithms i can think of
- a GUI
	- enter your text into an input field and press the right button to get the response you want! you can encrypt or decrypt using a toggle button
